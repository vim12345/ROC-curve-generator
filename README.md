# ROC-curve-generator
# Description:
The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is a graphical plot that illustrates a binary classifier’s performance as its discrimination threshold varies. It plots True Positive Rate (TPR) against False Positive Rate (FPR) and helps assess model quality. In this project, we generate and visualize the ROC curve for a logistic regression model using the Iris dataset (binary case).

# ✅ What This Does:
* Trains a logistic regression model

* Computes TPR, FPR, AUC score

* Plots a clean and informative ROC curve
